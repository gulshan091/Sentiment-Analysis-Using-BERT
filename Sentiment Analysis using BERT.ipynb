We all enjoyed our food, as well as our coffee and tea drinks.We were greeted immediately by a friendly server asking if we would like to sit inside or out. We said we would like inside, but weren't exactly sure how many were joining us yet- at least 4. We were told this was no problem, the more the merrier. A few minutes later when 4 more joined our party and we explained to the server we had 6, he just quickly switched our table. I really enjoyed my serenity tea, just what I needed after a long flight in from Sfo that morning. Everyone else were more interested in the lattes for expresso drinks. All said they were hot and delicious. 2 of us ordered the avo on toast. So yummy with the beetroot... I will start adding this to mine now at home, and have fond memories for my trip to Sydney. 2 friends ordered the salmon Benedict- saying it was delicious, and their go to every time they come here. 2 friends had a breakfast sandwich- I'm not sure of the name. It did look delicious. Adorable cafe, friendly staff, clean restroomsVery popular with the locals. I plan to come back the next time I'm in Sydney\",\n",

It really gave us a sour taste of how bad breaky is in America with what's so readily available in Sydney! \\xa0Both days we went were Saturdays and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, the cafe is extremely busy for both dine-in and take-away. Service is fairly quick and servers are all friendly. The location is in Surrey Hills a couple blocks away from the bustling touristy Darling Harbor.The green smoothie is very tasty and refreshing. We tried the smoked salmon salad, the soft shell crab tacos, ricotta hotcakes, and the breaky sandwich. All were delicious, well seasoned, and a solid amount of food for the price. A definite recommend for anyone's trip into Sydney!\",\n",
